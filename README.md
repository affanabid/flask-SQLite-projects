# flask-SQLite-projects
I have created these projects using flask webframework and SQLite database.
## 1. Cafes project
## 2. Flask User authentication 
## 3. Library project
The program hosts a web application using flask which allows the user to add new books, edit the ratings of already existing books and delete the previously added books. 
Moreover, since the application is connected to database, the book data is not lost even if the program is stopped and rerun again.
