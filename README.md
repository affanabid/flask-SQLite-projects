# flask-SQLite-projects
I have created these projects using flask webframework and SQLite database.
## 1. Cafes project
The project displays a list of cafes along with the information of WiFi availability and coffee prices. It also allows user to edit the information or add a new cafe with its services details.
## 2. Flask User authentication 
The program uses flask authentication procedures to verify the user through the data available in database and conclude whether the user should be allowed to pass the login page or not.
## 3. Library project
The program hosts a web application using flask which allows the user to add new books, edit the ratings of already existing books and delete the previously added books. 
Moreover, since the application is connected to database, the book data is not lost even if the program is stopped and rerun again.
## 4. My Blog Website
The project displays a blog app that contains all the previously created posts along with the comments on them. The program also allows new users to register and authenticates already existing users before logging them in. The users ,once registered or logged in, are then allowed to create and post their own blog and comment on the already existing blog posts. Only the admin user has the authority to delete the existing posts.
